# map_tnseq

    To understand what the program does and to
    learn how to run the program on KBase, refer
    to the PDF document in the directory 'documentation':
    [KBase app Explanation](documentation/RBTnSeq_Mapping.pdf)
    To test the app on your system as a developer,
    download the repo, start up Docker Desktop,
    run 'bash docker_fix.sh', then run 'kb-sdk test'.

    Mapping transposon insertions to the location in the genome.

    Inputs:
        FASTQ Reads files with insertions.
        Genome Information: Genbank file and an FNA file for the entire genome with
            the scaffolds labelled the same way.
        Model Information: The transposon beginning and ending sequence.
            e.g.
                nnnnnnCTAAGATGTCCACGAGGTCTCTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGACAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG
        maxReads per FastQ: If FastQ contains 10^7 lines, and you set maxReads as 10^6,
                            then the program will stop reading after 10^6 lines
        minQuality: If a read has a quality measurement below the minQuality, 
                    then throw out the read.
        delta: Minimum length of mapping to the genome after the end of the model
        minN: For a barcode to be considered good enough, it must have more than this number of hits.
    

This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).

You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).

You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/map_tnseq) or its [spec file]($module_name.spec).

# Setup and test

Add your KBase developer token to `test_local/test.cfg` and run the following:

```bash
$ make
$ kb-sdk test
```

After making any additional changes to this repo, run `kb-sdk test` again to verify that everything still works.

# Installation from another module

To use this code in another SDK module, call `kb-sdk install map_tnseq` in the other module's root directory.
