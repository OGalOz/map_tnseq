parameters :
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Genome   
        short-hint : |
            The Genome your checking your reads against to find locations of barcodes.
        long-hint  : |
            ??
    fastq_ref :
        ui-name : |
            The FastQ files to run hits against
        short-hint : |
            The reads in Fastq/a format as a KBase Single End Library Object.
        long-hint  : |
            The Map Tn Seq Program takes a set of Reads objects and Analyzes each.
    model_name :
        ui-name : |
            Model Name 
        short-hint : |
            The name of the model file you'll be using.
        long-hint  : |
            The model file has a specific format. You may be able to use one of the existing models,
            or you can upload a custom one by choosing Custom.
    test_mode :
        ui-name: |
            Test Mode?
        short-hint : |
            Run the program on the first 100 lines of your reads to check if your model is correct.
        long-hint : |
            In order to save time looking for the correct model, simply run Test Mode on various models until 
            you find one that matches.
    custom_model_string :
        ui-name : |
            Custom Model Text 
        short-hint : |
            The text for your custom model. Must follow the format in description.
        long-hint  : |
            If you chose "Custom" as your model, then you must input the text for the model. Examples given
            in the app description, including format restrictions.
    minN :
        ui-name : |
            minN
        short-hint : |
            An integer. minimum number of "good" reads for a barcode supporting its mapping.
        long-hint : |
            (Int) An optional input to the Design Random Pool program. minN is the minimum number of "good" reads for a barcode supporting
            its mapping.  (Good means a unique hit to the genome and qBeg=1.) Must be greater than 1.
    minFrac :
        ui-name : |
            minFrac
        short-hint : |
            A float. minFrac is the minimum fraction of input reads for the barcode that
            agree with the preferred mapping. Must be between 0 and 1
        long-hint : |
            (Float) An optional input to Design Random Pool. minFrac is the minimum fraction of input reads for the barcode that
            agree with the preferred mapping. Must be between 0 and 1.
    minRatio :
        ui-name : |
            minRatio
        short-hint : |
            A float. minRatio is the minimum ratio of
            reads for preferred mapping over the 2nd-most-frequent mapping. Must be greater than 0.
        long-hint : |
            (Float) An optional input to Design Random Pool. minRatio is the minimum ratio of reads for preferred mapping over the 2nd-most-frequent mapping. Must be greater than 0.
    output_name :
        ui-name : |
           Output Name 
        short-hint : |
            The name of your output files.
        long-hint  : |
            Give a name with no spaces or special characters.
