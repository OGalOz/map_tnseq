        long-hint  : |
            This is the genome to whose genes we are going to match barcodes so they can be used to measure the abundance of strains with those genes interrupted.

        long-hint  : |
            The Map Tn Seq Program takes a set of Reads objects and maps the embedded barcodes to a location in the genome.

        ui-name : |
            max Reads per FASTQ
        short-hint : |

            An integer. The minimum quality (from Illumina) for all nucleotides for a barcode to pass.
        long-hint : |
    minIdentity :
        ui-name : |
            min Identity
        short-hint : |
            Integer. Minimum Identity for read against genome to be counted as a map to the location.
        long-hint : |
            Input to BLAT 8
    minScore :
        ui-name : |
            min Score
        short-hint : |
            Integer. minimum length of mapping to genome or past-end of model and input to BLAT
        long-hint : |
    delta :
        ui-name : |
            delta 
        short-hint : |
            Integer. minimum length of mapping to genome or past-end of model
        long-hint : |
    minN :
        ui-name : |
            minN
        short-hint : |
            An integer. minimum number of "good" reads for a barcode supporting its mapping.
        long-hint : |
            (Int) An input to the Design Random Pool program. minN is the minimum number of "good" reads for a barcode supporting its mapping.  (Good means a unique hit to the genome) Must be greater than 1. 2 is a good estimate for low coverage data (MiSeq). 10 is the default and works well for high-coverage data.
    minFrac :
        ui-name : |
            minFrac
        short-hint : |
            A float. minFrac is the minimum fraction of input reads for the barcode that
            agree with the preferred mapping. Must be between 0 and 1
        long-hint : |
            (Float) An optional input to Design Random Pool. minFrac is the minimum fraction of input reads for the barcode that
            agree with the preferred mapping. Must be between 0 and 1.
    minRatio :
        ui-name : |
            minRatio
        short-hint : |
            A float. minRatio is the minimum ratio of
            reads for preferred mapping over the 2nd-most-frequent mapping. Must be greater than 0.
        long-hint : |
            (Float) An optional input to Design Random Pool. minRatio is the minimum ratio of reads for preferred mapping over the 2nd-most-frequent mapping. Must be greater than 0.

        ui-name : |
           max Query Beginning 
        short-hint : |
            The max location index within the query for which the query can be matched to genome.

    pool_description :
        ui-name : |

            KBase Pool.
        long-hint : |
            This description is used to understand where pool files come from 
            and their purpose. Please use only letters, spaces, and numbers.

            future RBTnSeq analysis runs such as Reads to PoolCount. Select yes
            if you believe this poolfile is the one you will be using in the 
            future.
    output_name :
        ui-name : |
           Output Name 
        short-hint : |

    <p>A KBase Wrapper for Morgan Prices's <a href="https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/feba/src/master/"> MapTnSeq code. </a></p>
    <p>The specific scripts from the feba code used are </p>
    <p> bin/MapTnSeq.pl, bin/DesignRandomPool,
     lib/FEBA_Utils.pm, lib/PoolStats.R</p>
    <p>The output of the program is a pool file (TSV), which you can choose to be 
    made into a KBase Object. It will be returned to you in a zipped directory
    either way (as long as you don't choose test-run). </p>
    <p>The format of the pool file will be described at the end of this page.</p>
    <p> Test-run is for checking if the Reads and the Genome are related</p>
    <p> The output map-tnseq files are tab-delimited and contain, for each usable \n
    read, the read name, the barcode, which scaffold the insertion \n
    lies in, the position of the insertion, the strand that the read \n
    matched, a boolean flag for if this mapping location is unique or \n
    not, the beginning and end of the hit to the genome in the read \n
    after trimming the transposon sequence, the bit score, and the \n
    %identity. </p>
